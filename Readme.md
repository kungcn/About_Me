# Readme
## What I have done in the codes
In those files, I achieve my own page called "About Me" to let people know more about me. And it is my first time to use JavaScript in html file.
## The organization of the files
There are two things in the repository, one was called **Readme.md** and another is **src** folder. In **src**, there are pictures used in the files, which were got in copyright-free picture site and Baidu Photos. Meanwhile, **AboutMe.html** and **AboutMe.css** exists as well.
## Special things in my codes
* JavaScript was used.
* Pass the tests of w3c.
* A .mp4 video appears in the website and I think  I should make some explanations here. First of all, this is the video to pre-order Jibo, developed by the team from MIT. I had a chance to see much videos about robots accidentally and I chose this because I thought it was more close to our life instead of Asimov, developed by Honda, etc. What's more, it was downloaded in Youku. 
* Two photos about bulb was used in the website too. I made some change to them by 画图 in Windows. However, I just downloaded them during the course of JavaScript on w3school.
* Because I wrote the files when I was designing, I think maybe the layout is not quite good and I think I will update it in some time.
